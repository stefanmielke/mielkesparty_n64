### Building

This game uses [libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon) to build. You can checkout instructions on how to setup the environment [here](https://github.com/werkn/n64devkit-everdrive).

After that you can build using ```make all``` inside the ```/src``` folder and it should generate the ```z64``` file in the root folder of the project.
